## Conflict Plan  

1. What is the group process to resolve conflict, when it arises? 
  - Time limit is set to 30 minutes of discussions. 5 minutes a piece for everyone's voice to be heard (questions, comments, concerns).

2. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?  
  - Coming together as a group and talk to that individual about where they are at and what needs to happen to catch back up. If it continues to escalate then we will get a TA or the Teacher involved at that point. 

## Communication Plan 

1. How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  - We have agreed to talk through Slack and we also shared phone numbers with one another for backup. 
  -	Sunday through Thursday: 9:30 pm to finish with the day (NO TEXTING AFTER THIS TIME).
  -	Friday through Saturday: 10-10:30 pm to finish with the day (NO TEXTING AFTER THIS TIME).

2. What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  -	First 15 min of class, share daily goals and this time will also be for questions, comments, concerns.

3. How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  -	We as a team came up with the idea that this is a friendly space and that if there are any problems with one another, that will be discussed between those two individuals. The most important thing is that there are no dumb questions and everyone’s opinion matters. 

## Work Plan  

1. How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?  
  - Share user stories with one another. 
  -	Find what kind of project we want to do as a group.
  - Break down project tasks (grooming the backlog).
  - Assign points of most importance to tasks, share strengths to certain tasks. 
  - Share what tasks should be a group task and what should be single tasks. 

2. What project management tool will be used? 
  - GitHub Project (first choice)
  - Trello (second choice)

## Git Process  

1. What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  - Everything will live on GitHub. If anyone makes personal notes, then those will be shared via slack or e-mail.

2. How will you share the repository with your teammates? 
  - We made each of us a collaborator for this project.

3. What is your Git flow? 
  - Everyone makes their own branch from dev branch, which is our default branch. The naming convention for the individual branch is the initial of team member's name, followed by hyphen and feature's name. i.e. `wp-constructor` 

4. Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  - How many people must review a PR?
    - Everyone will be reviewing the PR during the merge party.
  - Who merges PRs? 
    - At the end of the day when everyone is finished with their work and have discussed the merge.
  - How will you communicate that it's time to merge? 
    - We have discussed that 30 minutes before the end of the day we will share screens and discuss the merge before merging.
