          <p>
            <strong>Be Motivated!</strong>&nbsp&nbsp 
            It is not my job to motivate you to serve your country. You have to be motivated and understand that your fitness level could be the difference between life and death for you, your partner, or a victim you are attempting to save.<br></br>
            
            <strong>Train for Upper Body Strength:</strong>&nbsp&nbsp 
            Make sure you can do pushups, situps, and even pull-ups of some form as these exercises will help you climb fences or rope, jump walls, and handle an opponent if needed. Practice with weights, walls, ropes, and fences. Do not assume that you can accomplish these skills without practice.<br></br>

            <strong>Eat Right for energy:</strong>&nbsp&nbsp 
            Eating good carbohydrates and protein rich foods like fruits, veges, lean meats is the best tool for energy to exercise and prepare physically for training. Too many people rely on energy drinks which are really just caffeine and sugar to spike your central nervous system, not provide proper sustainable fuel for workouts."<br></br>
